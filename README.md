# Image-to-Text and Text-to-Speech Pipeline

This project demonstrates a Python pipeline that utilizes Hugging Face's transformers library to perform image-to-text and text-to-speech conversions. The pipeline allows you to provide an image URL, extract text from the image, and then convert that text to speech using the ESPnet text-to-speech model.
